# interview-questions
These are the normal interview questions sorted company specific.

I took the initiative to write down the questions and their answers as a go for an interview. When I get a call for interview I normally used to prepare some basic things required and give the interview. No questions were recored an nothing. I thought it would be helpful if I start mainting the prepartion questions and the questions asked to me in interview company wise. Using this lot of people can benifit. These are not Big companies, these are the companies which I have given interview to. 

This is basic setup. You can suggest your ideas to imporve.
